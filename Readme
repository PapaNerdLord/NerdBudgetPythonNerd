1:Gathering initial Budget inforamtion Name, Paydays, Wage, etc.
1.a:Being able to recall this information to be used without the code.(Probably does am idiot)
1.b:Making it overall more personalized for the person using it.
1.c:Having the code being super adjustable and flexible for the user. With options on how saving works etc.

2:Gather New Bill Informations and save it as a text file or as binary.
2.a: Bills will notify amount to save for the payperiods 

3: Having the ability to modifiy any and all informations within code from name to very last thing just to be accurate
